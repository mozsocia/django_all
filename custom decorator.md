In Django, you can place the `auth_required` decorator in any module or file that is accessible by your views. Here's a common approach:

1. Create a `decorators.py` file in your Django app (if it doesn't exist already).
2. In the `decorators.py` file, define the `auth_required` decorator as shown in the previous response:

```python
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def auth_required(view_func):
    def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated:
            return redirect('login')  # Replace 'login' with your login URL

        return view_func(request, *args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper
```

3. Save the `decorators.py` file.

Next, you need to apply the `auth_required` decorator to your view functions. You can do this in the same file where your views are defined or in a separate `views.py` file within your app.

For example, assuming you have a `views.py` file in your app, you can import the `auth_required` decorator and use it like this:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .decorators import auth_required

@auth_required
def my_view(request):
    # View code goes here
    ...
```

Make sure that the `decorators.py` and `views.py` files are located within the same directory (e.g., the app's directory) so that you can import the `auth_required` decorator correctly.

By following this approach, you keep your decorator separate from your views, making it reusable across different views within your app.
