Sure! You can create a mixin class that overrides the `save()` and `delete()` methods to handle the deletion of old image files when an update or delete process happens. Here's an example:

```python
import os
from django.db import models

class DeleteOldImageFilesMixin:
    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Delete old image file before deleting the instance
        for field in self._meta.fields:
            if isinstance(field, models.ImageField):
                file_field = getattr(self, field.name)
                if file_field:
                    # Delete old file
                    if os.path.isfile(file_field.path):
                        os.remove(file_field.path)
        super().delete(*args, **kwargs)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Delete old image file before saving the instance
        if self.pk:
            old_instance = self.__class__.objects.get(pk=self.pk)
            for field in self._meta.fields:
                if isinstance(field, models.ImageField):
                    old_file_field = getattr(old_instance, field.name)
                    new_file_field = getattr(self, field.name)
                    if old_file_field != new_file_field and old_file_field:
                        # Delete old file
                        if os.path.isfile(old_file_field.path):
                            os.remove(old_file_field.path)
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

This mixin class `DeleteOldImageFilesMixin` can be added to any model that has image fields. Here's how you can use it:

```python
from django.db import models
from yourapp.mixins import DeleteOldImageFilesMixin

class MyModel(DeleteOldImageFilesMixin, models.Model):
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/')
    # Other fields
```

With this setup, whenever you update or delete an instance of `MyModel`, the old image files associated with the `image` field will be deleted automatically. Make sure to adjust the paths and file handling logic according to your project structure and requirements.
